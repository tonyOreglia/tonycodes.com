          The world is better when people write more. Jumble is a space for
          daily flow of thought journaling. It implements the

          to support sustainable personal growth.
          <a href="https://jumblejournal.org" target="_blank">Jumble Journal</a>
          started as an experiment in

          and is today a profitable company where thousands of journal entries
          and insights are created daily.

          The world is better when people read more.
          <a href="https://air-books.app" target="_blank">Air Books</a> enables
          the sharing economy of books by making it literally effortless to
          upload your entire bookshelf as a digital bookstore. It does this by
          streaming images from your phone camera to an OCR pipeline to
          accurately identify the books on your shelf just from the view of the
          spines.

          I've worked for some exceptional technology companies
        </h2>
        <p>
          My career began working with hard drive firmware in C++ at Seagate
          where I continued as a Field application engineer. I continued with my
          focus on software development in Sydney with
          <a href="https://safetyculture.com/" target="_blank">SafetyCulture</a
          >, an Australian unicorn. At SafetyCulture I developed the public API,
          working closely with enterprise customers to understand real world
          usage, and helped build the initial version of a task managements
          system on their flagship application, iAuditor. Next, I joined
          <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/" target="_blank">Dashlane</a> in
          Lisbon, Portugal. Dashlane is a web security engineering company at
          it's heart, and I learned a lot from some very smart people there. I
          even had the chance to do a year of R&D, resulting in
          <a
            href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240012933"
            target="_blank"
            >a patented invention that is in use today</a
          >
          in Dashlane's zero knowledge SSO architecture. I also worked on
          monetization and subscriptions in my first experiences as a technical
          lead.
        </p>
        <h2 id="blog">Exploring ideas in writing</h2>
        <p>
          On <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, I post about technology, business,
          history, and some armchair philosophy. I also keep a
          <a href="/garden">digital garden</a> with notes (some half baked) on
          all sorts of subjects. I also
          <a href="https://x.com/tony_oreglia" target="_blank">post on X</a>
          occasionally. Typically I start each day with twenty minutes of
          journaling my flow of thought. Journal helps me explore ideas, stay
          centered and start the day creating instead consuming.
        </p>

          I played rugby for ten years, including three years with Waverley
          Rugby Club in Bondi Beach, Australia. Now I do endurance sports and Ju
          Jitsu. I completed a
